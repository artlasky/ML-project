# ML-project

This is a project representing my first attempt at 
Machine Learning. It is part of a collections of projects
from my enrollment in the Data Science Bootcamp, sponsored by Jovian at:

https://jovian.ai/learn/zero-to-data-analyst-bootcamp

This project is a Machine Learning example that demonstrates
the use of Linear Regression as a technique for predicting house prices.

It takes a collection of house sales in the U.S. Once the data is
read in, columns are split up into a target and the others used
for analysis. The data will be split up into separate parts for
training and analysis. This process builds a model that can be
used for price predictions.

This process is known as Linear Regression and tests predictions
against  actual sales and minimizes losses.

The implementation makes use of Python's Scikit-learn library
and detail will be found in the project notebook.
